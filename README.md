This piece of code is to generate JSON outputs from CSV rows, which have to be in order with a given JSON schema.

#### Steps to run:
* Install gradle, spark, jvm and scala sdk on your system.
* Go to root directory of this project and then run `./gradlew clean build run` to compile and run.

After this, JSONs outputs will be printed on console.
